-- About --
An example Python client for the Chatterbox Sentiment Detection API delivered through the Mashape platform.  The API is designed specifically for short social texts.

This client has some hard coded (but real) tweets which are passed to the API.

You need to add your keys found on the Mashape Dashboard.

-- Code --
The example code is found in example.py. You can run this by typing

python example.py

The mashape folder contains the Mashape API code.  At the time of writing this was current (June 2012), although you should check for a new version.
